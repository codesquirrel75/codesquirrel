				Hi My name is Ken.  I am a licensed Electrician. My hobbies are building robots, programming, and learning new things.
				I have studied PHP, Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, CSS, HTML.  I'm not a pro at any of them but I know the basics.  I have built a web app with PHP for the company I work for.   It was an employee portal type app that we could sign into and make up material orders and send the order to the desiered vendor.
